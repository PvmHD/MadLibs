MadLibs
=======

A simple java text based game.


The general idea of what is intended is that the computer will read an exterior file, and every time it stops at something like < noun > it will ask the reader basically "please input a: noun", so I first want it to find the instance of a < word > and read it, and then I want to be able to change that word to what the user inputted by creating a new file of this new story.
